    <p>
        I'm Ryan Ramon. I recently graduated in December of 2021 from Texas A&M
        University- Corpus Christi with a bachelor of science (computer science).
        For as long as I can remember, I've known my calling to be in technology.
        In my earlier years, I had been infatuated by the internet and spent plenty
        of time playing videogames. I had always been curious about how games, websites,
        mobile apps, and other software are made. My enrollment was part
        of a life-long pursuit towards aquiring the necessary knowledge for becoming
        a professional web-developer, game programmer, or software engineer.
        What satisfies me in my work, is the apparent improvement of my skills. I've 
        taken part in projects that I have sincerely been proud of, yet I'm always left 
        with the urge to improve, and perfect my craft.
